      <h2 class="center-title">Who We Are</h2>
      <p>Flowers On Thorns Community-Based Organization (CBO), located in Roysambu, Nairobi County, Kenya, is dedicated to transforming the lives of vulnerable youth and young children in Roysambu and beyond. Through holistic interventions—ranging from psychosocial support, trauma recovery, and vocational training to education, life skills development, and advocacy—FOT targets marginalized young people, especially young mothers, street-involved youth, and those affected by early pregnancy, addiction, and crime.</p> 
      <p>Our approach includes running rehabilitation and daycare centers, distributing care packages, nurturing talents, and offering safe shelter and reintegration services.</p>
      <p>We work in partnership with communities, institutions, and local government using participatory methods to ensure sustainability and long-term impact, with the ultimate goal of building a safer, more empowered, and self-reliant youth population. This strategic plan will be implemented through participatory approaches with both public and private partners, locally and internationally.</p>

In 2019, after recognizing the challenges faced by boys and young men, the group expanded to include them and rebranded as <strong>Flowers On Thorns</strong>. The organization was officially registered as a Community-Based Organization (CBO) on <strong>19th November 2024.</strong></p>
